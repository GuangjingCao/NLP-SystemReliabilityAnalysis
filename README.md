# NLP-SystemReliabilityAnalysis
• Participated in a 10-week NSF-funded summer REU program at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) focused on advanced applications of artificial intelligence in engineering safety. Engaged in interdisciplinary data science research under the mentorship of WPI faculty
• Processed and analyzed unstructured text using NLP techniques, including tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization. Implemented and evaluated clustering algorithms (K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and built predictive models with Support Vector Machines (SVM). Leveraged cosine similarity and knowledge graphs to develop a recommendation system that suggests actions based on input descriptions.
